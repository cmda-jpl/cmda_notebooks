## Quick Tips for CCS students

### Setting up your workspace
Upon logging into your server, you should find the following two directories:

**cmda_notebooks** contains CMDA python library and associated notebooks, while **ccs2020** is a copy (created the first time you log in) that is intended to serve as your workspace. Restarting your server will always force a resync of the cmda_notebooks directory, which can be useful for applying bug fixes. **To ensure that your work is not overwritten upon restarts, please save all your work in the ccs2020 directory only.**

### Workspace Overview

- `cmda.py` and `fillna.py` contains the main library code. Do not edit these!
- `datasets.csv` and `variables.csv` contain a variable and dataset table that you can open to see the list of available datasets and variables.
- `cmda.ipynb` is a template notebook which provides a brief tutorial for using the CMDA GUI in Jupyter.
- `example1.ipynb` is a tutorial notebook showing how to use the CMDA universal analysis tool in Jupyter..
- `Topic6_RCMES` Contains notebooks for topic 6.

### Restarting your Server

Restarting your server manually may be necessary to apply updates. To restart, go to **File > Hub Control Panel** and press the "Stop My Server" button twice, then press "Start My Server".

### Restarting your Kernel

If the CMDA GUI is not responsive in the notebook, restart your kernel by going to **Kernel > Restart Kernel**. This can be necessary if you are idle for too long or you have internet connectivity issues.
